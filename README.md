The Online Exam System is a simple Java-based console application designed to simulate a basic computer-based test (CBT) environment. The primary objective of this system is to allow a user to log in, update their profile (specifically the password), and participate in a timed multiple-choice examination. The system begins by prompting the user for a username and password. If the credentials match the pre-defined values, the user gains access to the main menu. From there, they can choose to update their profile, start the exam, or log out of the system.
The exam consists of three multiple-choice questions. The user is required to answer them within a certain time limit, and each correct answer contributes to their final score. Although the time check logic is implemented using System.currentTimeMillis(), the allowed time is incorrectly set due to a multiplication error (3010000 instead of 301000). Despite this, the flow of the application remains intuitive. The use of arrays to store questions and answers, along with Javaâ€™s control structures like switch-case and if-else, makes the implementation straightforward.
Tools used in the development include the Java programming language, a Java-supporting IDE (such as Eclipse or VS Code), and the Scanner class for handling user input. The application effectively demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as static methods, user input/output, control flow, arrays, and basic timing logic.
In conclusion, this project offers a practical example of how core Java can be used to build an interactive and functional console-based application. It is ideal for beginners in Java programming and serves as a solid foundation for more advanced applications like online testing systems with databases or web interfaces.
